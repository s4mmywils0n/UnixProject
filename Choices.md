# Choices Made for Automated Website Deployment with GNU/Linux Web Server

In this section, we document the choices made throughout the project and explain the reasoning behind selecting specific tools and services.

## 1. **Why DigitalOcean?**

**DigitalOcean** was chosen as the **VPS provider** for the following reasons:

- **Ease of Use**: DigitalOcean provides a user-friendly interface and simplifies the setup of virtual servers (called **Droplets**). This is ideal for beginners who need to quickly deploy a server without complex configurations.
  
- **Scalability**: DigitalOcean offers easily scalable options. We started with a basic instance, but it can be upgraded as the project grows.
  
- **Cost-Effective**: DigitalOcean's pricing is competitive and offers a low-cost entry point for small to medium-sized projects, which fits the budget requirements.
  
- **Documentation and Community**: DigitalOcean has an extensive collection of tutorials and a large community, making it easier to find solutions to common issues. This provides a strong support system for troubleshooting and learning.

**Alternative Options Considered:**
- **Linode**: A strong competitor with similar pricing, but DigitalOcean's interface and community support were more appealing for this project.
- **AWS EC2**: While AWS offers great flexibility and power, it has a steeper learning curve and is more complex for beginners. The setup and billing process are more intricate compared to DigitalOcean.

## 2. **Why Nginx?**

**Nginx** was selected as the **web server** for the following reasons:

- **Performance**: Nginx is known for its **high performance** and low resource usage, especially when serving static content. It is capable of handling a large number of concurrent connections, making it ideal for a web server.
  
- **Reverse Proxy Capabilities**: Nginx excels as a **reverse proxy** server, and this feature will be useful for handling HTTPS connections securely and forwarding them to backend services.
  
- **Ease of Configuration**: Nginx is relatively simple to configure compared to other web servers like **Apache**. Its configuration files are clean, and most changes can be made in just a few lines of code.

- **Popularity and Community Support**: Nginx is widely used in production environments, and it has a large community for support and resources.

**Alternative Options Considered:**
- **Apache**: Apache was considered due to its wide adoption and flexibility. However, Apache’s resource consumption is generally higher than Nginx, especially when dealing with a high number of simultaneous connections. Nginx offers better performance for this project’s needs, where high performance is a priority.
- **LiteSpeed**: LiteSpeed provides good performance and security, but it has a commercial license and is not as widely used as Nginx, making it harder to find community support.

## 3. **Why Debian?**

**Debian** was chosen as the **operating system** for the server for the following reasons:

- **Stability**: Debian is renowned for its **stability**, which is crucial for a server environment. It’s less prone to bugs and crashes compared to other distributions, such as Ubuntu, which is based on Debian but includes more frequent updates.
  
- **Security**: Debian has a strong security track record, with regular security updates and a well-documented security process.
  
- **Compatibility**: Most server software, including **Nginx** and **Git**, is well-supported on Debian. It is known for being lightweight and efficient, which is perfect for running web servers.
  
- **Long-Term Support**: Debian provides long-term support, which is important for maintaining a secure environment over time without the need for frequent OS upgrades.

**Alternative Options Considered:**
- **Ubuntu**: Ubuntu is a popular choice for servers due to its ease of use and large community. However, Ubuntu has a faster release cycle, which might lead to less stability compared to Debian, especially for production systems.
- **CentOS**: CentOS is another stable and secure option. However, it is being phased out in favor of CentOS Stream, which has a rolling release model. This change made Debian a more attractive option for long-term stability.
