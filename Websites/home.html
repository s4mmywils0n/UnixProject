            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
              BMW began producing automobiles in 1928 after acquiring
              Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach. In the 1930s, the company established its
              reputation with high-performance vehicles! The introduction of the
              BMW New Class in 1962 marked a turning point, solidifying BMW as a
              premier manufacturer of sporty, high-quality cars.
            </p>
            <p>
              <dfn>BMW M</dfn> (<b>Bayerische Motoren Werke</b>) was originally
              founded to support BMWâ€™s motorsport division, which saw tremendous
              success in the 1960s &amp; 1970s! M-badged vehicles feature
              high-performance modifications like enhanced engines, upgraded
              suspensions, and aerodynamic improvements. Rigorous testing at
              BMWâ€™s NÃ¼rburgring facility ensures precision and performance.
